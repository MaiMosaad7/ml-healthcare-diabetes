# ml-healthcare-diabetes
This project uses predictive modeling to identify high-risk diabetic patients and minimize hospital readmissions.

## ML Healthcare Diabetes Prediction:
The ML Healthcare Diabetes Prediction project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of hospital readmissions among diabetic patients. By identifying high-risk patients, the project aims to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce unnecessary readmissions.
The model provides accurate predictions based on patient demographics, medical history, lab results, and other healthcare-related data.

### Technologies Used:
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy,matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization, plotly, and tensorflow.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, GradientBoosting, and DecisionTree.

## MLFlow:
Integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment, making it easier to manage different experiments and track model performance.

### Workflow:
- Data visualization: analyze the data and find insights to understand our data. 
- Data Cleaning: Prepare the data by handling missing values and duplicated data.
- Data Preprocessing: encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze key patterns, correlations, and trends in the dataset.
- Model Training: Train various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict readmission risks.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Experiment Tracking: Use MLflow for tracking experiments, logging parameters, metrics, and models.
- Model Deployment: Save and deploy the trained models for real-time use.
  
##FastAPI:
- Use Postman to interact with your FastAPI server and test the prediction API
